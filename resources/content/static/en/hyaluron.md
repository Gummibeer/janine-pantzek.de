With hyaluronic acid, aesthetic medicine has found a highly effective way of restoring the youthful, fresh appearance of the face and body.

In my institute, I specialize in various methods of skin rejuvenation with hyaluronic acid. Modern hyaluronic acids with different molecular sizes and different viscosity allow for a wide range of applications. The hyaluronic acid fillers developed today consist of a smooth gel and are chemically produced in a laboratory.

Both the first small wrinkles and deeper folds (e.g., nasolabial folds) can be injected. Hyaluronic acid enables targeted facial contouring as well as optical cheekbone augmentation. The facial features appear plumper, fresher, and younger again due to more volume. As a result, the facial expression changes from tired, exhausted, and sad to an attractive, more feminine expression. Volume treatments of the lips as well as fine bumps on the bridge of the nose can be gently modelled.

Offer: **"Lifting to go"**: Here, hyaluronic acid is injected at strategically sustainable points on the face, so that the skin immediately looks firmer and fresher. As effective as a lifting, but without any surgery or downtime!

Offer: **"Glow to go"**: Creates a positive immediate effect on the face, neck and décolleté by injecting particularly fine hyaluronic acid, which is optimally distributed under the skin. The result: Your skin shines immediately after the treatment and has a fresh, youthful glow.

Hyaluronic acid is a moisture-binding sugar compound that is found in almost every cell in our body. It is responsible for elastic skin and the stimulation of collagen formation in the tissue. Its unique ability to bind water to itself - one gram of hyaluronic acid can store up to 6 liters of water - makes it particularly valuable in aesthetic medicine. The amount of hyaluronic acid naturally present in the skin decreases rapidly with age: The skin becomes drier, forms deeper and deeper wrinkles, and gradually sags. The result: the skin loses its firm and youthful appearance. The combination of Botox and hyaluronic acid has proven particularly effective for crow's feet, forehead wrinkles and frown lines and leads to particularly good results.

A filling effect lasts up to 24 months with the currently common hyaluronic acid fillers. The quality of the materials used is crucial in this respect. In my practice, I use only the highest quality, tested products that are broken down much more slowly by the body.
