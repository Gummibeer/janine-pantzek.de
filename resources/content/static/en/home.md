        headline: More quality of life for you

            My personal goal is for you to enjoy looking at yourself in the mirror every morning. You should feel attractive, healthy and fit - no matter how old you are. Since 2005, I have been using methods for the gentle treatment and correction of signs of aging without surgical interventions (so-called "nonsurgical procedures"). In addition to the classic fields of treatment, I also offer FACE DESIGN in this area. FACE DESIGN is an individual combination of different treatment methods, personally tailored to your needs - without downtime, but very effective. It is practically a facelift on a purely minimally invasive basis, without surgical interventions. FACE DESIGN also includes "JAWLINE CONTOURING" (chin-jaw contouring), in which, for example, an optically round face shape can be given a defined facial contour in just one session. For all treatments, we work with a precise 3D analysis of your face in advance and coordinate the treatment areas together.

            It is particularly important to me that the natural appearance of my patients is preserved with every procedure. I want to emphasize the individual facial contour in the best possible way instead of creating a "mask-like" face. For this, I use only the highest quality materials and substances. At the same time, my many years of experience as a doctor in the field of minimally invasive surgery guarantees treatments at the highest level.

        headline: Smart aging instead of ageism
        text: |-
            Resisting any form of aging, as the term "anti-aging" suggests, can be frustrating in the long run. It makes more sense and is more satisfying to influence the type of personal signs of aging (“smart aging”). Through the targeted use of biological filling substances such as hyaluronic acid, botulinum toxin A (Botox) and thread techniques, the degenerative aging process can be delayed with visible results.
