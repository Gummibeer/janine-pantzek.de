Bruxism is the unconscious grinding of teeth. Often this occurs at night, but there is also the so-called awake bruxism.

Bruxism is a habit that can be gruelling because it's not just your teeth that suffer. Often, tension, neck pain, headaches, pressure on the ears and tinnitus also make life difficult for those affected. Even visual disturbances or dizziness can occur.

### Treatment with Botox

Botox (botulinum toxin A) has proven to be very effective in this regard. It requires specific facial anatomy knowledge and experience in order to introduce the Botox as effectively and precisely as possible into the external masticatory muscle (the masseter) and to relax the muscles. Mrs. Dr. med. Pantzek has more than 15 years of experience in this field.

The relaxed muscle reduces teeth grinding and the accompanying pain decreases. The teeth are also worn less. The muscle is only weakened and not completely paralyzed, so there is rarely any impairment when eating, drinking, or chewing. After just a few days, there is a significant improvement in the symptoms.

A nice side effect: the constant grinding of teeth can sometimes enlarge the masseter muscle and make the face or jaw look wider. After the treatment with Botox, the masseter muscle becomes smaller and the face can also appear narrower.
