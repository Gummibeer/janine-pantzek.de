From the age of 30, our skin begins to age visibly. It increasingly loses collagen and elastin and the tissue slackens. To counteract this aged, tired look, I offer a gentle method of face lifting, without a scalpel and general anaesthesia: thread lifting with 4D technology.

Unlike other forms of wrinkle treatment, thread lifting does not just tighten the face. The cannula and thread types I use are characterized by their extremely high quality and workmanship and stimulate the body's own collagen production. In this way, a long-term and, above all, natural treatment result can be achieved. The face looks permanently rejuvenated and refreshed.

The thread lift is particularly suitable for patients for whom a complex facelift would be premature and who shy away from a surgical procedure under general anaesthesia. The procedure can be performed under local anaesthesia and without extensive preparation. Depending on the area of application, I use different threads, the composition, and special properties of which I will discuss with you in advance.

### Contour and freshness for the face

The main indications for thread lifting are the classic signs of aging on the face, but in principle, this method is suitable for all areas of the body. The main areas of application on the face are pronounced nasolabial folds, sagging cheeks, crow's feet, bags under the eyes or marionette, smokers, or glabellar wrinkles. Other possible positive effects:

* Lower jaw contouring and tightening
* Tightening of the chin area
* Tightening of the lower eyelids
* Mouth corner elevation
* Tightening of the cheeks, neck and décolleté

### Long-term effect through tissue strengthening

In my institute, I use the traditional suture material manufacturer, SERAG-WIESSNER, who has developed seralea, an innovative 4D technology for gentle lifting and filling with threads. The threads are inserted directly under the skin with very fine cannulas - irregularities is evened out and small wrinkles are tightened with the seralea hooks. The thread dissolves after 180-210 days, the strengthening of the tissue structure remains long beyond that.
