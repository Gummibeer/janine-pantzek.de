Harmony XL Pro is a laser treatment device manufactured by Alma, which rejuvenates your skin from within. It stimulates the collagen produced in your skin, tightens it visibly, and harmonises the complexion. It offers exceptional results with no downtimes.

Harmony XL Pro Laser can be used to treat wrinkles, large pores, skin sagging, rashes, skin texture, pigment disorders/blemishes (sunspots, age blemishes, melasma), vessels, facial erythrosis, thread veins, small veins, veins, haemangioma, port-wine stain, stretch mark scars and acne scars with minimum pain and risk. 

The Harmony XL Pro laser treatment makes use of a pixelated skin resurfacing laser to break light into numerous fragments that penetrate deep into the dermis of the skin. Even though you cannot see anything underneath the skin, the process stimulates skin deep inside to produce more collagen. More collagen means a lifted and tightened skin which aims at attaining overall rejuvenation and a more smooth, tight finish.
