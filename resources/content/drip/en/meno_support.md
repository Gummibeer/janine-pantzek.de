During menopause, the body needs support to stay in balance. This drip helps to stabilize the natural hormone balance in a gentle way - without hormone replacement therapy. It is also suitable to compensate for hormonal imbalances in those who wish to have children.

Until the onset of menopause, a finely regulated interplay of hormones in the body ensures that the cycle returns monthly. During menopause, estrogen production declines, causing menopausal symptoms in many women. With special infusions of vitamins, minerals and natural herbs, menopausal symptoms can be specifically counteracted. This combination of active ingredients is also an effective means of positively influencing the hormone balance in the body for younger women who wish to have children.
