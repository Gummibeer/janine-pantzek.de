Finally healthy and restful sleep again - and without any medication! This infusion is the right choice for anyone who longs to calm down quickly after a stressful day and sleep through the night without a break.

We all know the feeling: You are dead tired, but you cannot sleep. Or is up every few hours. Or just can't get back to sleep early in the morning. A horror scenario for anyone who achieves high levels of performance at work or must withstand a double burden between work and family. This special active ingredient cocktail of vitamin C and B complex, zinc, taurine, a double ration of magnesium and the particularly effective homeopathic substance tarantula ensures physical relaxation and a feeling of inner serenity, which has a lasting positive effect on the sleep cycle.
