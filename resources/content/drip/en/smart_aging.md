Would you like to maintain your physical and mental fitness even in old age? This highly concentrated drip supports the regeneration of your brain functions on a cellular basis. You feel more vital, energetic and radiant all around.

With advancing age, certain levels of concentration become more difficult, the metabolism is generally slowed down, and our energy balance is limited. With targeted infusions of vitamins, minerals and the miracle molecule NAD +, this aging process can be slowed down significantly. Harvard professor Dr. David A. Sinclair researched NAD + in the context of reproductive medicine and demonstrated its high effectiveness in the regeneration and new formation of cells. Our smart aging drip works like a fountain of youth!
