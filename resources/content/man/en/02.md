### A matter of skin: Man

Although skin aging starts later in men than in women, it is still advisable to start skin rejuvenation at an early stage, i.e., to fight wrinkles before they develop into deep furrows. The recommendation is to have the first treatments for forehead wrinkles, frown lines, smile lines, smoker's lines or dark circles around the age of 30 at the latest.
